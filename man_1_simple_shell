.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
\- A custom UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[\fIfile\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B simple_shell
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates the basic functionality of the Bourne shell (\fBsh\fR). It reads commands from either standard input or from a file and executes them.

.PP
In interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt and waits for user input. In non-interactive mode, it reads and executes commands in sequence from a file or a pipe until it reaches the end-of-file (EOF) or encounters the \fBexit\fR command.

.SH USAGE
.IP \[bu] 2
When you run the shell without arguments, it will start in interactive mode:
.nf
$ ./simple_shell
($) ls -l
($) pwd
($) exit
.fi

.IP \[bu] 2
When commands are piped or redirected from a file, it will run in non-interactive mode:
.nf
$ echo "ls -l" | ./simple_shell
$ cat commands.txt | ./simple_shell
.fi

.SH OPTIONS
The
.B simple_shell
does not currently implement any command-line options in its standard form. However, you may specify a script file as an argument:
.IP
.BR simple_shell " <script>"
.RS
Reads commands from the script file instead of standard input.
