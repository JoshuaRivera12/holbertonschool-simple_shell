.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
\- A custom UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[\fIfile\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B simple_shell
is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates the basic functionality of the Bourne shell (\fBsh\fR). It reads commands from either standard input or from a file and executes them.

.PP
In interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt and waits for user input. In non-interactive mode, it reads and executes commands in sequence from a file or a pipe until it reaches the end-of-file (EOF) or encounters the \fBexit\fR command.

.SH USAGE
.IP \[bu] 2
When you run the shell without arguments, it will start in interactive mode:
.nf
$ ./simple_shell
($) ls -l
($) pwd
($) exit
.fi

.IP \[bu] 2
When commands are piped or redirected from a file, it will run in non-interactive mode:
.nf
$ echo "ls -l" | ./simple_shell
$ cat commands.txt | ./simple_shell
.fi

.SH OPTIONS
The
.B simple_shell
does not currently implement any command-line options in its standard form. However, you may specify a script file as an argument:
.IP
.BR simple_shell " <script>"
.RS
Reads commands from the script file instead of standard input.
.RE

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP 8
.B exit
Exit the shell.
.TP 8
.B env
Print the current environment variables.

.PP
Additional built-ins may be added or customized as per the project requirements.

.SH EXTERNAL COMMANDS
The shell will search for external commands in the directories specified by the \fBPATH\fR environment variable. If a command is found, it is executed in a separate process using \fBexecve\fR(2). If the command is not found, an error message is displayed.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell inherits the environment from the parent process. Some environment variables that affect its operation include:
.TP 8
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.
.TP 8
.B HOME
The default home directory of the current user.
.TP 8
.B SHELL
The pathname of the current shell.

.PP
The shell allows you to modify, add, or remove environment variables at runtime.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of the shell is generally the exit status of the last command executed. If no command is executed, the exit status is 0. Built-in commands that fail will set a non-zero status.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP \[bu] 2
Interactive mode:
.nf
$ ./simple_shell
($) /bin/ls
main.c  shell.c  simple_shell
($) exit
.fi

.IP \[bu] 2
Non-interactive mode:
.nf
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./simple_shell
main.c
shell.c
simple_shell
.fi

.SH FILES
.IP
.B /bin
.RS
Common location of standard UNIX programs.
.RE
.IP
.B /usr/bin
.RS
Additional location for system-wide executables.
